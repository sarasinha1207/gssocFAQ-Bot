# Contributing to Gssoc FAQ

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels, including participants in GSSoC'25 (GirlScript Summer of Code 2025) and the broader open-source community.

## How to Contribute

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Navigate to the main repository page on GitHub
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### Step 2: Clone Your Fork
Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

### Step 3: Create a New Branch
Always create a new branch for your work. Never commit directly to the main branch:
```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Use descriptive branch names like:
- `feature/add-login-page`
- `fix/navbar-responsive-issue`
- `docs/update-readme`

### Step 4: Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Test your changes thoroughly before committing
- Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes
Write clear and meaningful commit messages:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Brief description of changes"
```

Good commit message examples:
- `Add user authentication feature`
- `Fix responsive design issue in header`
- `Update documentation for API endpoints`

Avoid vague messages like:
- `Update`
- `Fix bug`
- `Changes made`

### Step 6: Push Your Changes
Push your branch to your forked repository:
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

### Step 7: Create a Pull Request
1. Go to your forked repository on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request"
3. Fill out the pull request template with all required information
4. Add a clear title and description of your changes
5. Link the related issue using keywords like `Closes #issue-number` or `Fixes #issue-number`
6. Attach proof of work (screenshots or videos showing before/after changes)
7. Submit the pull request
