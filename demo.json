    "Project description": "This Adopative AI Based Traffic Management System The basic idea of a traffic signal where vehicles are lined up in four lanes: Lane 1, Lane 2, Lane 3, and Lane 4. A camera or sensor system will simultaneously capture images of all four lanes. These captured images will be stored within a single frame. The stored frame will then be processed using the YOLO API, an artificial intelligence-based object detection model. By analyzing the detected vehicles in the image, the vehicle density of each lane will be determined. Based on the calculated vehicle density, the signal timing will be set accordingly. If the vehicle density exceeds a predefined range, a fixed setup timer will be applied to regulate the traffic flow.",
