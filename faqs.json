They choose issues, submit PRs, and follow project guidelines independently. - No need to be assigned to a mentor. \n\n **`Mentors`**: Experienced developers assigned to specific projects. They review PRs and answer contributor questions when needed. - Mentors support on demand and not assigned per contributor. \n\n **`Project Admins`**: Lead and manage each project. They coordinate with mentors, review progress, and ensure project quality. They mark the labels with *gssoc2025* and *level 1/2/3*. Please reach out to them by mentioning their GitHub ID in issue or PR comments, or by contacting them on Discord. You can access details of all mentors and project admins using the **`/project command`**."
